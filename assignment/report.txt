This file is a description of whole code in the project.

# HASH TABLE
 The Most important thing in this project is its data structure.
 Whatever its data structure, it must solve next condition.
 (In effect , it is about command 'P')

 1) SEARCHING WITH FULL KEY
  command 'G', 'D' takes 'key', and do proper action. So, there must be a process where the program finds unique data for the key in the data structure. If this process take less time and less inner process, that will be great.

 2) SEARCHING WITH SUBSTRING KEY
 command 'S' takes 'PART KEY' which consists of substring of key, number, and '*'.  It is same as 1). Less time, Less inner process required.

 3) MAKING LIST OF ALL THE KV PAIRS IN ALPHA-ORDER.
 command 'F' will make a file which contains all the k-v pairs the program have in alphabetical order. How about data structure have its data in alphabetical order at the begining?
